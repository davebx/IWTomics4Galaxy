# IWTomics4Galaxy

Implementation of the Interval-Wise Testing (IWT) for omics data. This inferential procedure tests for differences in "Omics" data between two groups of genomic regions (or between a group of genomic regions and a reference center of symmetry), and does not require fixing location and scale at the outset.

##This tool requires the following dependencies
1. R (https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. R/Bioconductor package IWTomics (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IWTomics.html)
